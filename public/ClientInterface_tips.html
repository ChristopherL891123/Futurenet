        <h1>Advice for Choosing the Right Model</h1>
        <div class="textbox">
            <h1>Visualize your goal</h1>
            <p>- If you would like to categorize your data use a classifier model.</p>
            <p>- If you would like to predict a value use a regression model.</p>
            <p>- If you would like to group together observations and draw conclusions from them use a clustering model.</p>

            <h1>Understand your dataset</h1>
            <p>- All models automatically clean for NaN values.</p>
            <p>- This project is more suited for small to medium dataset sizes.
               Expect performance drop when it comes to a larger dataset; our experts are currently upscaling our infrastructure.</p>
            <p>- Numbers-based datasets are best for regression.</p>
            <p>- Category number-based datasets are best for classifiers or clustering; it is important to have a goal in mind before choosing one!</p>

            <h1>Experiment your Ideas!</h1>
            <p>- There are many models to use for your own Machine Learning projects, so feel free to experiment all you like until 
              you find a model that suits your needs.</p>
            <p>- Feel free to experiment your ideas through our service!</p>
            <p>- As of yet, there is no limit to model requests per user. Expect this to change soon.</p>
